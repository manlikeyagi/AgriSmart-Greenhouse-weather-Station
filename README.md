# AgriSmart-Greenhouse-weather-Station
# weather station project using NodeMCU
Prototype & Development of Weather Station 
The weather station for the greenhouse integrates several sensors with a NodeMCU microcontroller and the Blynk app for remote monitoring and control. The primary components include a light sensor, rain sensor, and DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. IoT system must monitor such weather parameters as temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, light intensity, rainfall
Function:
Collects and displays weather data to provide insights into external conditions affecting the greenhouse.

How It Works:

Light Sensor: Measures sunlight intensity for assessing natural light availability.
Pressure Sensor: Records atmospheric pressure to detect weather changes.
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor: Provides temperature and humidity readings.
Rain Sensor: Detects rainfall.
LCD Display Screen: Shows real-time weather data for easy monitoring.
